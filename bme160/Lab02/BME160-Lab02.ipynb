    "Remember that all data returned from input() is a string object, so this will mean that you need to convert any numeric data to their respective numeric objects. The exercises in this lab will give you practice manipulating various types of data that commonly arise in computational biology problems.\n",

    "For the Coordinate problem, I followed the instructions provided in class and then inserted them to the main() function of the coding cell, making some modifications to make sure everything worked correctly. To deal with the single line of input, we converted the input string to a list, with each object separated by a comma, and then purposefully selected the nine list items necessary for the problem. My tactic for this problem and the others this week was to produce something workable using a procedural approach, then to insert it into the OOP skeleton that was already in the lab file. The principal area where I had to introduce something not discussed in lab was with the print functions. With the help of groupmates, I used f-strings to smooth out the process of introducing significant figures. To convert from radians to degrees, I multiplied the actual angle calculated as coordinateTriad.angleQ() by 180/3.14159265, which is roughly the same as 180/pi."
